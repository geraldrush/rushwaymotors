				<h2>Understanding your basic consumer rights as a motorist</h2>
				<aside>
					<h2>MIWA – Motor Industry Workshop Association: </h2>

					<p><em>MIWA, the Independent Workshop Association, representing general repairs, auto electrical; air conditioning; accessories and fitment as well as transmission and driveline workshops strives to remain ahead of the ever-changing technologies and best practices of the aftermarket motor industry.</em> </p>
				</aside>
				
				<p>Understanding the Consumer Protection Act and your basic consumer rights as a motorist is important, says Jakkie Olivier, CEO of Retail Motor Industry Organisation (RMI).
				“As an organisation that champions the rights of motorists and service providers in the motor industry we often come across cases where there is little to no understanding of the basic rights as captured in the Consumer Protection Act. This leaves parties open to possible exploitation,” he says.
				In essence, there are nine basic consumer rights which include: the right to equality in the consumer market and protection against discriminatory market practices; the right to privacy; the right to choose; to disclosure of information; to fair and responsible marketing; to fair and honest dealing; and accountability from suppliers. It also includes the right to fair, just and reasonable terms and conditions, and the right to fair value, good quality and safety.</p>
				<p>“There are several sections with in the Act that are particularly pertinent to the buying, maintenance and repair of vehicles. What’s important to take note of is that these sections need to be read within the context of the Act as a whole to ensure there are no misinterpretations. We always advise motorists and service providers to rely on the counsel of legal experts or knowledgeable laymen in the matter,” says Olivier.</p>
