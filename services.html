					<p>Engine overhaul is basically giving your engine a new life. Most engine wears out over time due to heat and normal wear and tear. Some engine deteriorate quicker than others from being driven too hard like a race car. Or it’s affected by not enough engine oil, or lack of maintenance. The list goes on.

					In short, everything has a shell life. And your engine is no different. When you notice your engine oil level is always dropping, fuel efficiency is not as good as before or there are weird sound coming from the engine, it’s best to consult a mechanic to check of there is a need to overhaul your engine.

					Overhauling your engine is not a simple task. It consist of deconstructing of the engine and having new internal components such as new pistons, piston rings, main bearings, valves and springs. There are many more steps to be listed but just know that other than the engine, everything inside will be new!

					The engine is removed from the chassis for this job, instead of leaving it in the chassis of your car. The process typically takes about a week to complete as all parts are dissembled and then fixing them back again.

					The benefits of overhauling your engine is pretty obvious. You will enjoy the engine like it’s brand new. Better fuel consumption will be seen. More quieter engine like a new car and the power of your engine will be back!

					<figcaption><h2>Suspension Repair</h2></figcaption>
					<p>A car’s suspension system is an integral part of its mechanical hardware. It suspends tires and more importantly, bears the weight of the vehicle through its complex assembly comprising mainly of shock absorbers and struts. We often tend to take our car’s suspension system for granted and hardly cares for it in the way we devote attention to the engine, transmission, and braking system of the car.
					It is important to note that without the proper working of the suspension, one won’t be able to handle the car properly especially during negotiating a turn or applying the brake. It is, therefore, in the best interest of you and your car to take good care of the suspension system
					
					 One essential part of the care is to sense early warning signals and to help you out on that, we list down some of the important indicators as follows:
					<ol>
					<li> Bumpy Ride: Have you suddenly started experiencing bumps inside the car? If yes, then it is one of the most apparent indicators of the worn-out suspension system. If you start feeling every pothole and even small undulations on the road filtering directly into the cabin, it’s an indication that you are car’s suspension system has damaged and required some corrective maintenance. Most of the time, this condition hints that piston-cylinder assembly inside the shock absorber of suspension might be worn out and need replacement. However, this bumpy ride could also be on the part of the damaged strut and hence you should get the whole suspension assembly of the car checked thoroughly.</li>

					<li>Unnerving Turns: If during negotiating a turn, you feel that the car is drifting or pulling then it means that all is not well with the suspension. This happens because the suspension of the car is not able to contain the vehicle against the impact of centrifugal forces. Just so you know centrifugal forces come into action when you start negotiating a turn trying to throw the car in and out depending upon the direction of the turn. This is a serious concern and you should immediately take your car to the service center. Apprise the technician about this issue and ask him to check the suspension system of the car thoroughly.</li>

					<li>Nose-Diving: In case of a worn-out suspension system, you might also start experiencing the phenomenon of nose-diving. In nose-diving, you feel that the car’s body lurches forward when you apply the brake. The situation becomes really disconcerting in case of emergency braking when you push hard on the pedal to avoid some imminent collision. The nose-diving has serious implications for your safety and security as it interferes with your car’s ability to stop within the required distance. The impact of the nose-diving on braking can be gauged from the fact that it can negatively affect your car’s stopping time by as much as 20%. In such a situation, you should not delay getting this fault rectified as soon as possible.</li>

					<li>Uneven tire wear: If you notice uneven tire wear with some bald patches appearing on one tire while none on another, it’s time to get suspension system of your car checked. This is an indication that the suspension of the car is not able to hold tires evenly and might require replacement of the damaged shock absorbers or struts. Tire treads can also wear unevenly on account of misalignment and wrong balancing, and hence along with the suspension setup make sure you get tires aligned and balanced by a professional car set-up.</li>

					<li>Leaky Suspension: Slip beneath the car and if you notice any oil-leakage from the suspension system, it’s time to visit the workshop. The most obvious cause of the oil leakage is faulty shock absorbers which should be replaced to keep the car from further damage. The replacement of the shock absorbers is a costly affair; however, it will go a long way in keeping other mechanical and driving issues at bay.</li>

					<li>Bounce Test: One of the easiest Do it Yourself (DIY) methods to find out whether suspension of your car has worn out is to take the Bounce Test. Park your car at even surface and press the front of the car down with your own weight. Go to the rear of the car and repeat the same exercise. You should do it twice or thrice with both front and rear sections of the car and then carefully notice the response of the car. If you find your car shaking even after you release the force then it signals that the suspension system has worn-out and requires replacement or maintenance of the damaged components.</li>

					<figcaption><h2>Car Service</h2></figcaption>
					<p>For many motorists, filling up with petrol or diesel, and having the fuel attendant check their oil level is as far as they go in terms of regular vehicle maintenance.Do you know how to spot an oil leak? Do you know how to check your oil level? What happens under the bonnet is often of little concern can be intimidating for novice drivers.</p>
					
					<p>Basic checks to save you money

					Regular maintenance checks, that can be easily performed by any driver, can help ensure that your vehicle runs properly. You can also diagnose problems early before they leave you stranded as a result of a breakdown. Regular checks can also save you from hefty repair bill.</p>
					7 essential car checks:

					1. Oil level

					Inspect your car's oil level at regular intervals, such as when refueling your car. This should be done when the engine is warm but has been switched off so that the oil can settle. Remove and wipe the oil dipstick with a clean cloth, then check the level – it should be between the maximum and minimum marks. Top up if necessary with a high-quality oil (part or fully-synthetic oils are best), but make sure not to overfill as this can damage the engine. Some vehicles don’t have a conventional dipstick and rely on an electronic read-out when started – check that the oil level reading is correct.

					2. Oil leaks: Have a look around and underneath the engine, gearbox and differentials for any signs of oil leaks. This may indicate a minor issue such as a leaking gasket or seal, or could suggest a bigger problem that requires urgent attention.

					3. Coolant level 

					Coolant is critical to the operation of your car’s engine. Make sure that the coolant is maintained at the recommended level at all times in the reservoir bottle next to the radiator, and check for leaks. Never rely on water alone for engine cooling – use a quality engine coolant, typically known as anti-freeze or summer coolant, mixed according to the manufacturer’s recommended ratio (typically 1 litre coolant to 3 litres of water). This coolant prevents freezing in cold temperatures, as well as boiling when the engine gets hot. It also resists corrosion, rust and scale build-up that would reduce the efficiency of the cooling system.

					The coolant level in the reservoir must only be checked or filled when the engine is cool – never open the reservoir cap (or radiator cap) when the engine is hot.

					4. Radiator

					Inspect the radiator for visible leaks or blockages. It relies on uninhibited airflow to lower the temperature of the engine coolant. Carefully remove any debris in front of the radiator if necessary. The fan should kick in automatically at a predetermined engine temperature – if not and the engine runs hot, have the fan and the radiator thermostat checked by a professional service centre such as Auto Car & Diagnostics (ACD), or Silverton Radiators – both of which are owned by Aftermarket Solutions.

					5. Brake system 

					Keep the brake fluid level topped up to the correct level on the brake reservoir. If there are any leaks around the reservoir or any of the brake discs or drums, or the brake performance is diminished, have the system inspected immediately.

					Examine the brake pads and discs for excessive wear. ACD also does brake system maintenance and repairs. 

					6. Other levels 

					Various additional oil and lubricant levels should also be checked, including power steering, clutch and gearbox, where relevant. Depending on vehicle, some of these items can only be inspected by a service centre.

				7. Battery and warning lights 

					Most modern batteries are sealed, maintenance-free units. Examine the battery for any signs of cracks, leaks or corrosion on the terminals.

					When starting your car, all of the engine check, oil and coolant levels, battery, brake and ignition lights should come on briefly then go off. If any of the warning lights remain on this indicates a problem – ignoring the issue won’t make it go away, and it could result in extensive damage and expensive repairs.

					8. Scheduled servicing 

					Your vehicle should be serviced regularly, based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. This could vary from every 5 000 km for some older diesel engines to 10 000, 15 000 or 20 000 km. Some vehicles employ an on-board service indicator that determines the service interval, which could be as high as 30 000 km depending on driving conditions.

					If the mileage interval isn’t reached, the car should still be serviced annually to ensure that all the lubricants and filters operate effectively, as they degrade both with use and age.

					Do not exceed the recommended service intervals, as these are designed to ensure the optimum performance, safety, efficiency and reliability of your vehicle.
